Previous research    on climbing robots has focused on robots that climb using specialized end    effectors (such as suction cups or magnets) or robots that climb by exploiting    features of their environment (such as robots that climb in tubes or on surfaces    such as trusses or chain link fences). In contrast, my research hopes to    enable climbing in irregular environments using friction properties of the    environment. Such ability would be useful not only in terrestrial search    and rescue, but also in exploration of steep surfaces on other planets such    as crater walls on the moon and Mars. </p>  <p>My research builds from previous research <a href="images/pic02.jpg"><img src="images/lemurhand100.jpg" width="100" height="76" border="0" align="right" /></a>done    in the <a href="http://arl.stanford.edu/">Aerospace    Robotics Lab</a> by <a href="http://arl.stanford.edu/%7Etbretl/">Tim Bretl</a>.    He developed a method to plan the path of a climbing robot up an artificial    rock wall for robots having a frictional contact on a surface. He then demonstrated    the effectiveness of his path planning on <a href="http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/systems/system.cfm?System=5">JPL's    LEMUR IIb robot</a>. A <a href="http://sun-valley.stanford.edu/%7Etbretl/movies/lemur.mpg">video    of LEMUR's climb (6 Mb)</a> is available from Bretl's webpage. While the    plan for this climb was completely valid, LEMUR had some trouble in the execution.    The motion plan generated joint angle trajectories that LEMUR followed using    PD joint angle controllers. If large joint angle errors were detected, a    safety mechanism in the controller stopped the robot to reduce the possibility    of a fall. This happened fairly often and for a variety of reasons. Joint    motors saturated, hands slipped off holds, and holds were not in the locations    the surveyor described. Joint angle control does not have built in knowledge    of limitations and constraints imposed on the robot and also has no mechanism    to feed back the state of the robot with respect to these constraints. </p>  <p>To remedy these problems I have designed a controller called Cartesian Force,    Convex (CFC) control that considers constraints on the robot and only generates    torques that do not violate those constraints. </p>  <p align="center"><a href="images/blockdiag.jpg"><img src="images/blockdiag450.jpg" alt="block diagram of cfc controller" width="450" height="143" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>This controller  has two key features:</p>  <ul>    <li>The controller tracks a planned trajectory by feeding        back information about the robot CG position (x). The position of the        CG of the robot is given by the motion planner and corresponds to a location      at which it is possible for the robot to maintain equilibrium. Using a        control technique such  as PD control, a desired force on the CG is generated. </li>    <li>Next, the desired force on the CG is achieved by using a convex optimization      technique (such as linear programming). This ensures that the desired force      is achieved without using torques that exceed torque limits or cause the      hands to slip off of holds.</li>    </ul>  <p>Additionally, given the many degrees of freedom for the climbing robots    used in these studies, it may be possible to achieve more goals than those    explicitly stated above. For example, I choose to minimize the norm of the    joint torques for longer robot battery life, and also to minimize the angle    of forces applied to holds with respect to the hold normal to increase robustness    to hold angle and friction property errors. </p>  <p><a href="images/chimneyoverlaybig.jpg"><img src="images/chimneyoverlaybig151.jpg" width="151" height="150" border="0" align="right" /></a><a href="images/ffclimb.jpg"><img src="images/ffclimb139.jpg" width="139" height="150" border="0" align="right" /></a>I    have demonstrated the effectiveness of this controller on Stanford's Free-flyer    robots. These robots operate in a horizontal plane, but by hanging a weight    on a pulley over the edge of the table an artificial gravity environment    can be simulated. The figure on the right shows the robot climbing holds    that are in a chimney configuration. These holds are vertically oriented    so that the robot must not only push up to climb, but must also push out    just to keep its hands in the holds. The CFC can make this climb even in    the presence of hold position errors, whereas a joint angle controller is    unable to keep the robot from falling. </p>  <p><a href="images/lemurstuck1590.jpg"><img src="images/lemurstuck1590-161.jpg" alt="photograph of lemur robot stuck" width="161" height="125" border="0" align="right" /></a><a href="images/lemursim1590.jpg"><img src="images/lemursim1590-156.jpg" width="156" height="125" border="0" align="right" /></a>This    controller has also been tested in simulations of JPL's LEMUR IIb robot.    The images at right show a position where the robot actually became stuck    while climbing because of an upper arm motor saturating. In the simulation    using CFC control, the robot was able to redistribute torque to other motors,    and with a lower arm helping push up LEMUR was able to complete the climb.    I hope to demonstrate CFC control's effectiveness on the actual LEMUR robot    in the near future. A major obstacle to this implementation is that LEMUR's    joints are highly geared and nearly completely non-backdrivable. This    is an appropriate design technique for climbing robots because if motor current    to the joints is set to zero, the robot doesn't move and battery life is    conserved. However, this makes control of joint torques and robot endpoint    forces very difficult without direct measurements of these values. (This    is opposed to the joints on the free-flyer robots which are direct drive,    so motor torque is proportional to current.) </p>  <p>My near term research will involve    resolving the problem of controlling  climbing robots with highly geared    joint motors. I will be working with the robot built by Professor Jean-Claude    Latombe as part of his <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Elatombe/projects/projects-www.html#_Climbing_robots">climbing    robotics</a> research. A photograph of this robot is forthcoming. </p>  <h4>Further reading: </h4>  <p>Climbing Robots</p>  <blockquote>    <p>T. Bretl.
