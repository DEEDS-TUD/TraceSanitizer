and Recreation (at the Basketball Court) from 4:15pm to 5:05pm.

It is a rare opportunity to experience what students of Wing Chun
go through, as material not normally shown to beginners will be
taught.

Basement of the math building (Main Quad building 380).

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
The Stanford University Wing Chun Student Association is a student organization
dedicated to teaching Wing Chun Kung Fu (詠春拳).
We are affiliated with the
<a href="http://smap.stanford.edu/">Stanford Martial Arts Program</a>.
</p>
<p>
Wing Chun is one of the more well-known Chinese martial arts, and there
are many webpages that describe it. See for example
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_chun">the Wikipedia entry on
Wing Chun</a>.
The founder of our club,
<a href="more.html">Eddie Oshins</a> had also written
<a href="old.html">some pages on Wing Chun</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you're interested in joining, first drop by and watch.
The relatively unstructured and informal nature of our classes demands
dedication, patience and self-motivation from the students.
This does not suit everyone.
We prefer our prospective members to have some idea of
what they're getting into.
