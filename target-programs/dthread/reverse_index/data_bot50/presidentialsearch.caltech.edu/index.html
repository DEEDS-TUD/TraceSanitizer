      <h1>The Presidential Search</h1>

	<p>
	On October 3, 2005, Dr. Baltimore announced his plans to step down in
	June 2006 as Caltech's president. The process to select his successor
	began immediately. This site was used during the initial part of the
	search to solicit input from members of the Caltech community about
	the qualities the next president should have and potential candidates
	for the position. The work by the faculty presidential search
	committee and the trustee presidential selection committee was
	completed and the new president was announced to the Caltech community
	on Friday, May 26, 2006. 
	</p>

       <p>
	Caltech's eighth president will be Dr. Jean-Lou Chameau, the provost
	and vice president for academic affairs at the Georgia Institute of
	Technology. He will take office on or before September 1. Please <a

	the official announcement</a> for more information about Dr. Chameau.
