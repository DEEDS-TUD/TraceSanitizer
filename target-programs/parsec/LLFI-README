## PARSEC Overview

We had a look at the following benchmarks. We got some of them working.

### Kernels
in `pkgs/kernels`

#### Working
- **streamcluster**: fully working, C++

#### Not Working
- **canneal**: clang works, LLFI-instrument throws exception...

      terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
      what():  basic_string::_S_construct null not valid
     
      originating in:
      llfi-passes.so  0x00007fc585ae9fe4 llfi::demangleFuncName(std::string) + 180

- **dedup**: not working due to ssl fips compile issue

### Apps
in `pkgs/apps`

#### Working
- **blackscholes**: fully working, C
- **ferret**: fully working, C, instr takes longer
- **fluidanimate**: fully working, C++
- **swaptions**: fully working, C++
- **x264**: fully working, C, instr takes extremely long

#### Not Working
- **bodytrack**: clang seems to work, but we have still unresolved compile issues for clang+pthreads, serial instr crashes with same exception as canneal
- **facesim**: clang cannot compile due to C++ template issue: template types are instantiated before the template is complete, which clang does not like (but gcc does)
- **freqmine**: only support OpenMP, no pthreads
- **raytrace**: not tried yet
- **vips**: not tried yet
